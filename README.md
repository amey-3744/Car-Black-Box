🚗 Car Black Box System (Embedded C)
The Car Black Box is an embedded system project designed to record and monitor critical vehicle data such as speed, gear position, and events (like sudden brake or crash).
This system helps in accident analysis and vehicle monitoring, similar to an aircraft black box.

✨ Features
Records vehicle speed and gear position
Detects and logs critical events (Brake / Crash)
Real-time data display on LCD
Data stored in EEPROM for future analysis
UART support for data retrieval
Password-protected access (optional if implemented)

🛠️ Hardware Used
PIC16F877A Microcontroller
16x2 LCD Display
Matrix Keypad
EEPROM
Potentiometer (Speed simulation)
Push Buttons (Event detection)
UART Interface

💻 Software Used
Embedded C
MPLAB X IDE
XC8 Compiler
